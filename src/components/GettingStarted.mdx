## Why Use Storybook for an ArgoCD Extension?

Using Storybook for this ArgoCD extension enables isolated UI component development without relying on a local ArgoCD cluster, greatly simplifying the development process. It also allows UI components to be tested in CI, naturally integrating visual and interaction tests into the continuous delivery pipeline. Finally, the interactive documentation provides a centralized space where contributors can review and test components, creating a shared technical reference.
